`2>/dev/null` sends the errors to the void
`>` sends the output to an archive
`<` gets the input from the file to the command
`<<` add a standard input through a stream example:
```shell-session
cat << EOF > stream.txt
```
`|` redirect the output to another command example:
```shell-session
find /etc/ -name *.conf 2>/dev/null | grep systemd | wc -l
```
## Useful Commands
[[find]]
```shell-session
 find / -type f -name *.conf -user root -size +20k -newermt 2020-03-03 -exec ls -al {} \; 2>/dev/null
```

## User Management

- `userdel` Deletes a user account and related files.
- `usermod` Modifies a user account.
- `addgroup` Adds a group to the system.
- `delgroup` Removes a group from the system.
