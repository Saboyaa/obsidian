## Tricks
`2>/dev/null` sends the errors to the void
`>` sends the output to an archive
`<` gets the input from the file to the command
`<<` add a standard input through a stream example:
```shell-session
cat << EOF > stream.txt
```
`|` redirect the output to another command example:
```shell-session
find /etc/ -name *.conf 2>/dev/null | grep systemd | wc -l
```
