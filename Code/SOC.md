A Security Operations Center (SOC) is an essential facility that houses a team of information security experts responsible for continuously monitoring and evaluating an organization's security status.
Various technology solutions, such as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) as the [[ELK Stack]], Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems ([[IDS/IPS]]), and Endpoint Detection and Response ([[EDR]]) tools, are utilized by the SOC team to monitor and identify security threats. They also make use of threat intelligence and engage in threat hunting initiatives to proactively detect potential threats and vulnerabilities.

## Roles Within A SOC
- `SOC Manager`: Oversees day-to-day operations, manages the team, coordinates incident response efforts, and ensures smooth collaboration with other departments.
- `Tier 1 Analyst`: Monitors security alerts and events, triages potential incidents, and escalates them to higher tiers for further investigation.
- `Tier 2 Analyst`: Performs in-depth analysis of escalated incidents, identifies patterns and trends, and develops mitigation strategies to address security threats.
- `Tier 3 Analyst`: Provides advanced expertise in handling complex security incidents, conducts threat hunting activities, and collaborates with other teams to improve the organization's security posture.
- `Detection Engineer`: A Detection Engineer is responsible for developing, implementing, and maintaining detection rules and signatures for security monitoring tools, such as SIEM, IDS/IPS, and EDR solutions. They work closely with security analysts to identify gaps in detection coverage and continuously improve the organization's ability to detect and respond to threats.
- `Incident Responder`: Takes charge of active security incidents, carries out in-depth digital forensics and containment and remediation efforts, and collaborates with other teams to restore affected systems and prevent future occurrences.
- `Threat Intelligence Analyst`: Gathers, analyzes, and disseminates threat intelligence data to help SOC team members better understand the threat landscape and proactively defend against emerging risks.
- `Security Engineer`: Develops, deploys, and maintains security tools, technologies, and infrastructure, and provides technical expertise to the SOC team.
# The Triaging Process
`Alert triaging`, performed by a Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst, is the process of evaluating and prioritizing security alerts generated by various monitoring and detection systems to determine their level of threat and potential impact on an organization's systems and data. It involves systematically reviewing and categorizing alerts to effectively allocate resources and respond to security incidents.
`Escalation` is an important aspect of alert triaging in a SOC environment. The escalation process typically involves notifying supervisors, incident response teams, or designated individuals within the organization who have the authority to make decisions and coordinate the response effort.
## Timeline of a Triaging Process
1. `Initial Alert Review`:
	- Thoroughly review the initial alert, including metadata, timestamp, source [[Network Protocols|IP]], destination IP, affected systems, and triggering rule/signature.
	- Analyze associated logs ([[Network]] traffic, [[Linux Logs|system]], application) to understand the alert's context.

2. `Alert Classification`:
	- Classify the alert based on severity, impact, and urgency using the organization's predefined classification system.

3. `Alert Correlation`:
	- Cross-reference the alert with related alerts, events, or incidents to identify patterns, similarities, or potential indicators of compromise (IOCs).
	- Query the [[SIEM]] or log management system to gather relevant log data.
	- Leverage threat intelligence feeds to check for known attack patterns or [[Malware]] signatures.

4. `Enrichment of Alert Data`:
	- Gather additional information to enrich the alert data and gain context:
	    - Collect network packet captures, memory dumps, or file samples associated with the alert.
	    - Utilize external threat intelligence sources, open-source tools, or sandboxes to analyze suspicious files, URLs, or [[Network Protocols|IP]] addresses.
	    - Conduct reconnaissance of affected systems for anomalies (network connections, processes, file modifications).

5. `Risk Assessment`:
	- Evaluate the potential risk and impact to critical assets, data, or infrastructure:
	    - Consider the value of affected systems, sensitivity of data, compliance requirements, and regulatory implications.
	    - Determine likelihood of a successful attack or potential lateral movement.

6. `Contextual Analysis`:
	- The analyst considers the context surrounding the alert, including the affected assets, their criticality, and the sensitivity of the data they handle.
	- They evaluate the security controls in place, such as firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and endpoint protection solutions, to determine if the alert indicates a potential control failure or evasion technique.

7. `Incident Response Planning`:
	- Initiate an incident response plan if the alert is significant:
	    - Document alert details, affected systems, observed behaviors, potential IOCs, and enrichment data.
	    - Assign incident response team members with defined roles and responsibilities.
	    - Coordinate with other teams (network operations, system administrators, vendors) as necessary.

8. `Consultation with IT Operations`:
	- Assess the need for additional context or missing information by consulting with IT operations or relevant departments

9. `Response Execution`:
	- Based on the alert review, risk assessment, and consultation, determine the appropriate response actions.
	- If the additional context resolves the alert or identifies it as a non-malicious event, take necessary actions without escalation.
	- If the alert still indicates potential security concerns or requires further investigation, proceed with the incident response actions.

10. `Escalation`:
	- Identify triggers for escalation based on organization's policies and alert severity:
	    - Triggers may include compromise of critical systems/assets, ongoing attacks, unfamiliar/sophisticated techniques, widespread impact, or insider threats.
	- Assess the alert against escalation triggers, considering potential consequences if not escalated.
	- Provide comprehensive alert summary, severity, potential impact, enrichment data, and risk assessment.
	- Document all communication related to escalation.

11. `Continuous Monitoring`:
	- Continuously monitor the situation and incident response progress.
	- Maintain open communication with escalated teams, providing updates on developments, findings, or changes in severity/impact.

12. `De-escalation`:
	- De-escalate when the risk is mitigated, incident is contained, and further escalation is unnecessary.
	- Notify relevant parties, providing a summary of actions taken, outcomes, and lessons learned.
