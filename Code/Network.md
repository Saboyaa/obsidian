A `network` is a collection of interconnected devices that can communicate

- `Nodes`Individual devices connected to a network.
- `Links`Communication pathways that connect nodes (wired or wireless).
- `Data Sharing` The primary purpose of a network is to enable data exchange.

## Types of Networks
The 2 primary types are `Local Area Network (LAN)` and `Wide Area Network (WAN)`

### Local Area Network (LAN)
connects devices over a short distance

- `Geographical Scope` Covers a small area.
- `Ownership` Typically owned and managed by a single person or organization.
- `Speed` High data transfer rates.
- `Media`Uses wired (Ethernet cables) or wireless (Wi-Fi) connections.
### Wide Area Network (WAN)
spans a large geographical area by connecting multiple LANs 

- `Geographical Scope` Covers cities, countries, or continents.
- `Ownership` Often a collective or distributed ownership (e.g., internet service providers).
- `Speed` Slower data transfer rates compared to LANs due to long-distance data travel.
- `Media` Utilizes fiber optics, satellite links, and leased telecommunication lines.

## Concepts
### [[OSI|OSI Model]]

The `Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model` is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstract layers. This model helps vendors and developers create interoperable network devices and software. 
### [[Network Protocols]]

`Protocols` are standardized rules that determine the formatting and processing of data to facilitate communication between devices in a network. These protocols operate at different layers within network models, each tailored to handle specific types of data and communication needs. Hereâ€™s a look at some common network protocols and their roles in data exchange.
### [[MAC Addresses]]
A `Media Access Control (MAC) address` is a unique identifier assigned to the network interface card (NIC) of a device, allowing it to be recognized on a local network.
### Port
A `port` is a number assigned to specific processes or services on a network to help computers sort and direct network traffic correctly. It functions at the `Transport Layer (Layer 4)` of the OSI model and works with protocols such as TCP and UDP. Ports facilitate the simultaneous operation of multiple network services on a single IP address by differentiating traffic intended for different applications.

### [[Internet Architecture]] 
`Internet Architecture` describes how data is organized, transmitted, and managed across networks.
### Wireless Networks
