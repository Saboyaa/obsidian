Crucial within the realm of computer protection, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) encompasses the utilization of software offerings and solutions that merge the management of security data with the supervision of security events. These instruments facilitate real-time evaluations of alerts related to security, which are produced by network hardware and applications.
## SIEM Lifecycle

1. `Requirements`: Comprehend the purpose or necessity of the use case, pinpointing the specific scenario for which an alert or notification is needed. Requirements can be proposed by customers, analysts, or employees. For instance, the goal might be to design a detection use case for a brute force attack that triggers an alert after 10 consecutive login failures within 4 minutes.
2. `Data Points`: Identify all data points within the network where a user account can be used to log in. Gather information about the data sources that generate logs for unauthorized access attempts or login failures. For example, data might come from [[Windows]] machines, [[Linux]] machines, endpoints, servers, or applications. Ensure logs capture essential details like user, timestamp, source, destination, etc.
3. `Log Validation`: Verify and validate the logs, ensuring they contain all crucial information such as user, timestamp, source, destination, machine name, and application name. Confirm all logs are received during various user authentication events for critical data points, including local, web-based, application, [[VPN]].
4. `Design and Implementation`: After identifying and verifying all logs with different data points and sources, begin designing the use case by defining the conditions under which an alert should be triggered. Consider three primary parameters: `Condition`, `Aggregation`, and `Priority`. 
5. `Documentation`: **Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)** detail the standard processes analysts must follow when working on alerts. This includes conditions, aggregations, priorities, and information about other teams to which analysts need to report activities. The SOP also contains the escalation matrix.
6. `Onboarding`: Start with the development stage before moving the alert directly into the production environment. Identify and address any gaps to reduce false positives, then proceed to production.    
7. `Periodic Update/Fine-tuning`: Obtain regular feedback from analysts and maintain up-to-date correlation rules by whitelisting. Continually refine and optimize the use case to ensure its effectiveness and accuracy.
