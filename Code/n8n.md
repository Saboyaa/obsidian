## Self-Hosting tutorial

### Pre-requisites
1. A Domain 
	I have used [[Cloudflare]] for this and next step and is the only part that have costs ( 7$ per year )
2. A tunnel ( also on [[Cloudflare]] )
	Go on Zero Trust -> Networks -> Tunnels
3. A virtual machine server 
	For this one i will use an [[Esp32]] because is the one i got on me but can be [[Raspberry]] too ( for testing purposes i will do on windows and only after pass to [[Esp32]] )
