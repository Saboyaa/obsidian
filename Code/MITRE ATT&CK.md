- `Detection and Response`: The framework supports SOCs in devising detection and response plans based on recognized attacker TTPs, empowering security teams to pinpoint potential dangers and develop proactive countermeasures. 
- `Security Evaluation and Gap Analysis`: Organizations can leverage the ATT&CK framework to identify the strengths and weaknesses of their security posture, subsequently prioritizing security control investments to effectively defend against relevant threats.
- `Threat Intelligence`: The framework offers a unified language and format to describe adversarial actions, enabling organizations to bolster their threat intelligence and improve collaboration among internal teams or with external stakeholders.
- `Red Teaming and Penetration Testing`: The ATT&CK framework presents a systematic way to replicate genuine attacker techniques during red teaming exercises and penetration tests, ultimately assessing an organization's defensive capabilities.
- `Training and Education`: The comprehensive and well-organized nature of the ATT&CK framework makes it an exceptional resource for training and educating security professionals on the latest adversarial tactics and methods.
