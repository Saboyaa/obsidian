The Domain Name System (DNS) functions as the internet's GPS, translating user-friendly domain names into the numerical IP addresses computers use to communicate. Like GPS converting a destination's name into coordinates, DNS ensures your browser reaches the correct website by matching its name with its IP address. This eliminates memorizing complex numerical addresses, making web navigation seamless and efficient.

The `dig` command allows you to query DNS servers directly, retrieving specific information about domain names. For instance, if you want to find the IP address associated with `example.com`, you can execute the following command:
```bash
dig example.com A
```
