`Threat hunting` is an active, human-led, and often hypothesis-driven practice that systematically combs through network data to identify stealthy, advanced threats that evade existing security solutions. 
This strategic evolution from a conventionally reactive posture allows us to uncover insidious threats that automated detection systems or external entities such as law enforcement might not discern.
## Threat Hunting Process

1. **Setting The Stage:**  The initial phase is all about planning and preparation. The preparation phase also encompasses making certain our environment is *ready for effective threat hunting*, which might involve enabling extensive logging across our systems and ensuring threat hunting tools, such as [[SIEM]], [[EDR]], [[IDS/IPS]], are correctly set up.

2. **Formulating Hypotheses:** The next step involves *making educated predictions* that will guide our threat hunting journey. These hypotheses can stem from various sources, like recent threat intelligence, industry updates, alerts from security tools, or even our professional intuition.

3. **Design The Hunt:**  Upon crafting a hypothesis, we need to develop a hunting strategy. This includes *recognizing the specific data* sources that need analysis, the methodologies and tools we'll use, and the particular *indicators of compromise (IoCs)* or patterns we'll hunt for.

4.  **Data Gathering and Examination:** This phase is where the active threat hunt occurs. It involves collecting necessary data, such as *log files*, *network traffic data*, *endpoint data*, and then analyzing this data using the predetermined methodologies and tools.

5. **Evaluating Findings and Testing Hypotheses:** This could involve confirming or disproving the hypothesis, understanding the behavior of any detected threats, *identifying affected systems*, or *determining the potential impact* of the threat.

6. **Mitigating Threats:** If we confirm a threat, we must undertake *remediation actions*. This could involve isolating affected systems, eliminating malware, patching vulnerabilities, or modifying configurations.

7. **After The Hunt:** Once the threat hunting cycle concludes, it's crucial to document and share the findings, methods, and outcomes.
